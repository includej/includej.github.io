Reject *escapism*, whether it disguises itself as entertainment or masquerades as art. Embrace the world and the human condition, no matter how disappointing and miserable they may be. Find yourself a mentor and a friend, a profession and a dream. If you choose to live this way, there will always be time for distractions that take you away from reality. So don't worry.

- Miyazaki
